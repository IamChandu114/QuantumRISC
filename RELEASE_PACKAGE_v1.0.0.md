## QuantumRISC Studio v1.0.0 - Production Release

QuantumRISC Studio v1.0.0 is the first production release of QuantumRISC, a backend-driven RISC-V CPU architecture and RTL engineering platform.

This release delivers a live engineering workstation for architecture exploration, simulation, and RTL debugging, with FastAPI and WebSocket integration powering real-time session state, waveform transport, and cycle-synchronized visualization.

### Highlights

- RV32I processor with a 5-stage pipeline
- FastAPI backend for session control, discovery, compile, run, step, reset, and snapshot operations
- WebSocket-driven live telemetry for real-time Studio synchronization
- Pipeline, register, memory, hazard, waveform, and performance workstations connected to backend snapshot state
- RTL Explorer backed by the project source tree and discovery payloads
- Production-oriented deployment path for Vercel and Railway

### Technical Notes

- The core Studio is backend-driven and does not rely on mock telemetry for its main execution views.
- Pipeline, registers, memory, hazards, waveforms, and performance panels reflect live backend session state.
- Cache, branch prediction, verification, and FPGA analysis panels are implemented as explicit engineering surfaces, and they show unavailable states when the backend does not emit the corresponding telemetry.
- The Studio preserves correctness over inference: when data is not available from the backend, it is shown as unavailable rather than fabricated.

### Validation

- Frontend production build passes
- Live backend session and websocket integration are in place
- Studio routes consume snapshot-driven session data
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/IamChandu114/QuantumRISC

### Scope

This release is intended for architecture review, RTL debugging, simulation analysis, verification workflows, and professional technical presentation.
